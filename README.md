# Hungry-not-Hangry
<h2> Personal Project Description </h2>
<p>This project was initiated to address the problem of people's indecisiveness when it comes to choosing where and what to eat. Often, we are overwhelmed by the possible foods to choose from and the places to eat at, leading to an unproportional ratio in time spent choosing where to eat and actually eating. As such, instead of putting so much time and effort to thinking of what/where to eat, why not let a Telegram chatbot randomly choose a place and restaurant for you, based off your preferences! That way, you can allocate the justified amount of effort to enjoying the food in front of you.</p>

<p>This project make use of Telegram bot, Google Sheets to hold the data of the food places, and Google Apps Script to host the algorithmic program of the Telegram bot.</p>
